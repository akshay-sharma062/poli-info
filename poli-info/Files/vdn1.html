            <!-- Candidate Info for 2019 -->
            <div class="info" id="candidate2019" style="display: none;">
                <p> Narpat Singh Rajvi (born 23 January 1952, Bikaner) is a five-time sitting Member of Legislative Assembly from Vidhyadhar Nagar constituency representing Bharatiya Janata Party and a senior politician from the Indian state of Rajasthan.
                    In 1990, Rajvi was credited with having engineered a split in the Janata Dal to save the Bhairon Singh-led BJP government, after ties between the two parties soured over L. K. Advani’s Rath Yatra.[1]

                    He was a MLA from Chittorgarh in 1993 and 2003 respectively. He has served as the Minister of Health and Industries in the government of Rajasthan.
                    
                    Since 2008, he fought assembly elections from Vidhyadhar Nagar, Jaipur and won 3 times (2008, 2013 and 2018) in the 2013 elections Rajvi defeated the INC candidate by a huge margin of 37,920 votes.His winning performance is attributed largely to the voters’ attachment to three-time Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhairon Singh, whose memorial is a prominent structure in the constituency.
                    
                    He was denied ticket from Vidhyadhar Nagar which resulted in discontent from his supporters. He made statements that sparked controversy. He alleged that Diya Kumari, who was given his candidature, came from the family which bowed down to Mughals. He was later pacified with a ticket from Chittorgarh, from where two-time winning MLA Chandrabhan Singh Aakya was dropped, which again created a huge uproar amongst the party workers who were supporters of the sitting MLA.
